4. Stage all files and commit with message: "Initial commit: Timberflow ERP with modular architecture"
5. Push to main branch

### Option 2: Command Line (if you have git access)
```bash
# Clean up any git locks first
rm -f .git/index.lock .git/config.lock

# Initialize and configure
git init
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
git config user.name "Your Name"

# Add files and commit
